## Introduction:

This is a single player basketball game where the player uses key commands to prompt their player to shoot the ball in the direction of the hoop. The space key is used to shoot the ball, the up and down arrows are used to move the ball, and the w and r keys are used to move the player. Once the player posesses the ball, one set of keys will be able to move both of the objects simultaneously.

## Basketball Class:

The basketball class features a hand-drawn basketball pixel, and it is coded for the ball to be moved in four directions. The movement of the ball is controlled by the up, down, right, and left arrows, and using these keys moves the ball in the corresponding direction. The ball is also equipped with collision detection, so that it is unable to leave the screen and go "out of bounds". When the ball collides with the player, the player posesses the ball, and the movement for both objects can be controlled with a singular set of keys.
